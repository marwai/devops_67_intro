# Introduction to DevOps

- 1 What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to 
deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations
using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to 
better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps consists of new product features, bug fixes, security updates and code refactoring

- 2 Why DevOps?

DevOps consists of bridging the gap between development and operations. It has stopped the monolith architecture,
enable efficient process. 


- 3 Challenges of DevOps

Breaking down teams from individual silos and bridge the gap of development and operations 

Awareness is crucial since scaling DevOps across the whole organisation may not be beneficial. Different apartments have
different needs. 

- 4 Benefits of DevOps

    - Faster time market - adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The 
    DevOps model enables developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and 
    continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.   
    - Improved team collaboration - Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values 
    such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many 
    responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover 
    periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).     
    - Continues release cycles - Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your
     product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your 
     customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices 
      automate the software release process, from build to deploy.   
    - Automated scaleable environments - Operate and manage infrastructure and development processes at scale. 
    Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. 
    For example, infrastructure as code helps manage development, testing, and production environments in a 
    repeatable and more efficient manner.   
    - Increase quality due to automated testing - Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes
     to reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use 
     practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. 
     Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.
